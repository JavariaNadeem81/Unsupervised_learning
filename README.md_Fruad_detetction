# Unsupervised Fraud Detection using Isolation Forest

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using **unsupervised machine learning**. Instead of relying on labeled data during training, the model learns the *normal behavior* of transactions and flags deviations as potential fraud.

The core algorithm used is **Isolation Forest**, an industry-standard technique for anomaly detection, particularly effective for large, highly imbalanced datasets like financial fraud.

## 🎯 Business Objective

Financial fraud is rare, unpredictable, and costly. Traditional supervised models require large amounts of labeled fraud data, which is often unavailable or delayed.

**Goal:**

* Identify suspicious (anomalous) transactions
* Minimize false negatives (missed fraud)
* Scale efficiently to millions of records

---

## 📂 Dataset Summary

The dataset contains **6.3+ million transactions** with the following characteristics:

* Transaction step (time-based)
* Transaction type
* Transaction amount
* Sender and receiver balances (before & after)
* Fraud indicators (`isFraud`, `isFlaggedFraud` — used only for evaluation)

> Identifier-like columns (e.g., account IDs) were excluded to avoid noise.

## 🧠 Modeling Approach

### Why Isolation Forest?

* Designed specifically for **anomaly detection**
* Handles **large-scale** and **high-dimensional** data efficiently
* Does not assume any data distribution
* Ideal for **rare event detection** like fraud

### Key Steps:

1. Drop high-cardinality identifier columns
2. Encode categorical features
3. Scale numerical features
4. Train Isolation Forest model
5. Generate anomaly scores and predictions
6. Evaluate using available fraud labels

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Git & GitHub

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Although the model is unsupervised, available labels were used **only for evaluation**:

* Confusion Matrix
* Precision / Recall / F1-score
* ROC-AUC using anomaly scores

This provides a realistic view of how well anomalies align with actual fraud cases.

---

## 📈 Visual Insights

* Fraud vs non-fraud distribution
* Transaction amount patterns
* Balance behavior before vs after transactions
* PCA-based visualization of anomalies

These visuals help interpret model behavior and validate results.

---

## 🚀 Key Outcomes

* Successfully identified anomalous transactions
* Clear separation between normal and suspicious behavior
* Scalable pipeline suitable for real-world deployment

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Feature engineering (ratio features, rolling statistics)
* Compare with LOF and Autoencoders
* Threshold tuning based on business risk
* Deploy as a real-time scoring service
